#Bento Grid Layout with Flexbox

A bento grid layout created entirely with Flexbox, without using display: grid. This project demonstrates how Flexbox can achieve complex, asymmetric layouts similar to a grid system, suitable for images, cards, and content blocks.

Customizable Layouts: Easily modify column and row spans by adjusting Flexbox properties.

Lightweight: No need for additional libraries or display: grid support.



Customize the layout by adjusting the flex properties in the CSS file. Experiment with different Flexbox settings to create unique patterns.
